#Project 2: Document Management System

The Document managements system manages files on my computer. The system needs
to be able to import files and record informaiton about each file that can be
indexed and searched.

Documents that need to be handled will be Reports, Letters, and Images. 

All documents need to record the path to the file that is being managed. I
need to be able to search these doucments. 

Allow the software to be able to add other types of documents in the future.
