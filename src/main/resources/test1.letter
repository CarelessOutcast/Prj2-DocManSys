Dear Tapia

I wanted to thank you for the invoice that you had sent me. I belive it was
discounted and because of that I specifically wanted to thank you. This is was
a very important surgery for myself and I was stressed beyond belief about how
I would be affording the bill. Again, I wanted to personally thank you for the
discounted rate!

regards,

John Doe
